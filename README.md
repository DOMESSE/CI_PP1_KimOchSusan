## Design

### Design Choices
The webpage was designed with a homely, small business, family owned feeling.
Ideally, the page evokes thoughts of the beatiful nordic nature.

### Color
The color scheme was inspired by nordic nature.

### Fonts
The whole page is done with Crimson Pro, followed by Helvetica and sans-serif as backups.

### Structure
The page is structured in a well know, recognizable, user friendly, and easy to learn way. Upon arriving to the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar with the restaurant logo on the left side and the navigation links to the right. 
The website consists of four separate pages: 
- A homepage, with a few photos of the people involved and a short introduction.
- An about us page, with some extra info on the people involved and a bunch of links to deepen the users understanding of the treatment options.
- A gallery, with a few images to give the user an idea of what to expect.
- A contact page with a form to provide contact information and a map.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to take the opportunity to thank:
- Mr Mo Shami, my mentor, for his feedback, support and great attitude despite my challenges.
- My friend David Caro Claromonte for helping me out when I got stuck with something, explaining iFrames to me, and overall feedback.
- Susan Rönnbäck and Joacim Österholm for the website idea, they are the owners of the clinic.
- Mo Shami's old students, who I learned immensely from.
- Font-awesome for the icons I used in my website.

## What would I've done differently

- If I had done this project again, I would've worked a lot more on the responsiveness of the webpage on different screen sizes.
- I would've made and added a logo to the webpage and I would've added a specific icon for the website.
- I would've made a more thorough readme, ex. bugs section, more device testing, testing user stories, etc.
- I would've tried out bootstrap.
- I'd have ordered the CSS rulings better from the very beginning.
